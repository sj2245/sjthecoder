# SJ The Coder

This is my portfolio website. I will showcase my projects here. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C Sharp, Unity Game Development, etc.

## Run The App

First, run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

If you have the dependencies installed already or you have a /node_modules folder already then go to next step.

If you are in VS Code, you can use the shortcut CTRL + J or CMD  + J on a Mac to open up the terminal.

In your terminal, run the below command.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server and it should give you a link like " localhost:3000 ".

You can then hover over this link in your terminal with your cursor and it should give you an option to hold Ctrl and click to open the link.

This link that you open up will be your local development, and changes you make will refresh the environment to show the changes.

## How to make new pages

First make a [pagename].mdx file as a Page

Then edit the _meta.json to add a new Nav Link

You can set the Display to Hidden to hide the nav menu link but have the page exist.
